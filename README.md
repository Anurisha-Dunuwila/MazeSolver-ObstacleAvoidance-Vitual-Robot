#  MazeSolver Obstacle Avoidance Robot using Webot Simulation

This project showcases the development of a robot capable of solving mazes and navigating through obstacles using image processing techniques and ultrasonic sensors. Integrated with a camera node, receiver, and ultrasonic sensors, the robot can detect various objects such as humans and building blocks while self-navigating towards the goal. Developed using C++ and Webots simulation software, this project was a finalist at the Robo Games 2020 organized by IESL.
